`full stack developer / AI enthusiast`

![me](me.webp)

I'm an indie full-stack developer mainly using Next.JS, I like building projects that solve a problem either for me or others. All my projects are built solo from designing, developing, testing, and deploying. All the content in my blog [nailed-it](https://nailed-it.tech) is written and published by me. I learned developing out of curiosity, now been doing it for over 10 years and I'm loving it.

<details> <summary><h2>üõ£Ô∏è My coding journey</h2></summary>
When I was young, I was impressed when I saw a guy in a movie typing stuff on the keyboard leading to something happening in real life like a door closing or a robot moving.

I was curious how they did that, but I had no clue.

At the age of 14, I discovered what they call "programming", and a friend of mine who had more experience in that field recommended that I start learning Python, and I did.

I was going all in all day every day on Codecademy, and I was impressed by this new world.
After finishing the course I decided that I wanna continue in this field, so I learned PHP, HTML, and CSS.

I still didn't know how to build something useful, and when I heard about WordPress, it caught my attention.

I found it really easy to build full apps quickly with drag and drop, this meant that I didn't have to deal with writing code, because tbh, I was having a hard time positioning a div in the center.

I spent a year learning everything about WordPress, and I reached a pretty good level.
I then joined a discord group for developers in which we would take weekly tasks, and the first was Bootstrap.

I was very impressed by how easy styling elements was using bootstrap.
I then learned React and this is where everything changed.
I learned how to make reusable components and pass props and for the first time, I had an idea of how real-world apps are made.

Then I learned Tailwind, mongoDB, and NextJS, and before I knew it, I was a full stack developer.

At this point, I had stopped using WordPress, because I realized that it's much better to write code as you have full control over everything.

Then I started to build big projects like e-commerce stores and I started to take on bigger freelance projects.

I learned more stuff along the way like UI libraries, writing clean code, and design principles.

I'm working on contributing to open source and building bigger projects.
